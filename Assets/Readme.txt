every Agent, the guys who move around need an Agent script, and a PathMover script. You probably also want to give them some kind of sprite so you can see them. 

I give my guys a circle collider and a ridgidbody so they bump into each other, as well as putting them on a player layer. but that is not really nessosary for the scripts to work. 

The PathMover script on each agent needs to be set up with a movespeed, and a fudge distance.
